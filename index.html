    <p>James Steven Donaldson , better known as MrBeast, is an American YouTuber and philanthropist. He is credited with pioneering a genre of YouTube videos that centers on expensive stunts. With over 150 million subscribers as of May 2023,he is the most-subscribed individual user on the platform and the third-most-subscribed channel overall.
    Donaldson grew up in a middle-class household in Greenville, North Carolina. He began posting videos to YouTube in early 2012 at the age of 13 under the handle MrBeast6000. His early content ranged from Let's Plays to "videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers." He went viral in 2017 after his "counting to 100,000" video earned tens of thousands of views in just a few days, and he has become increasingly popular ever since, with most of his videos gaining tens of millions of views. Over time, his style of content diversified to include challenge and donation videos that reward thousands of dollars, videos with arduous tasks or survival challenges, and original vlogs. Once his channel took off, Donaldson hired some of his childhood friends to co-run the brand. As of 2022, the MrBeast team is made up of 30 people, including Donaldson himself. Other than MrBeast, Donaldson runs the YouTube channels Beast Reacts, MrBeast Gaming, MrBeast 2 (formerly MrBeast Shorts),and the philanthropy channel Beast Philanthropy. He formerly ran MrBeast 3 (initially MrBeast 2), which is now inactive. He was one of the 10 highest-paid YouTubers of 2020, having an estimated net worth of $500 million.</p>
